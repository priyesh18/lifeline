It has two types of Users.

1. People
2. Hospitals



People can find hospitals/blood-banks near their location which makes It convenient for them to donate or find blood.

We show a list of the hospitals or blood-banks near them and

show their details.



We provide a rewarding system to users.They get a certain amount of credits after donating which is authenticated by the hospital/blood-bank they have visited.

The authentication is done by a QR code generated by the hospital temporarily and as soon as the QR code is scanned by the user it adds the points and deletes the QR code.

The reward system is only valid with registered hospitals and users.



They can use these rewards with companies our app has associated with.

An interesting approach which promotes donors to donate blood and also hospitals to register with us.
